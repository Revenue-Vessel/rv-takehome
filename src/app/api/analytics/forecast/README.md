# Forecast API Endpoint

This folder contains the API route for forecasting monthly revenue for the sales pipeline.

## Why a Separate File?
- **Separation of Concerns:** Forecasting is an advanced analytics feature, distinct from basic deal CRUD and analytics. Keeping it in its own folder (`/api/analytics/forecast/`) keeps the codebase organized and endpoints clear.
- **Scalability:** As more analytics features (e.g., win rates, trends, risk scoring) are added, grouping them under `/api/analytics/` makes the project modular and easier to maintain.
- **RESTful Design:** Grouping analytics endpoints separately from core resource endpoints is a best practice for clarity and maintainability.

## Documentation
All logic and documentation related to forecasting and advanced analytics will be added here for easy reference and future extension.
