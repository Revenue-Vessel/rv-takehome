## Assumptions

- Ease of Use Drives Adoption: The easier it is for a manager to identify which reps are underperforming or which deals need attention, the more valuable and indispensable the application becomes.
- Efficiency Directly Impacts Revenue: Reducing the time it takes to assign deals, filter territories, or analyze the pipeline translates into a faster sales cycle. Every click saved is time that can be spent on revenue-generating activities.
- Complexity Erodes User Confidence: A complex or inconsistent UI increases cognitive load, leads to user error, and creates a frustrating experience. Simplicity and predictability are essential for user satisfaction and long-term engagement.
