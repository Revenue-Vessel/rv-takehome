User: a Revenue Operations Leader
    - has "reps" he manages

Problem: 
    1. Reps accidentally compete for same deal (overlap, lack of tracking clearly)
    2. Currently using spreadsheet

Needs:
    Chunk #1:
        1. See "sales reps" clearly 
        2. Assign "sales reps" territories
            * Bulk re-assignment (multiselect) of "sales reps" to terrirotires


    Chunk #2:
        3. See deals by territories (and how many per territory)
        4. [LAST, if have time] Track performance across territories  



     UI - Sales Rep section:
            Two toggle-able views
                1. ✅ [CHUNK #1] table of reps (unique)
                    [x] A. name, contact, region, # of deals, territory
                    [x] B. multiselect + re-assignment capability

                2. ❌ (no time) [CHUNK #2] map view 
                    - deals location



Questions:
    1. what is considered a territory?
        - origin city or destination city?

        DECISION: 
            - new field for "territory" because freight forwarder could be receiver or shipper 
            depending on if they are importing or exporting
    
    2. how granular is a territory?
        - Could go more granular like "Southern California" or "NYC Metro"

        DECISION:
            - for time and simplicity just doing by state

    2. US or Global?
        DECISION:
            - for sake of time, limitig to US for now
