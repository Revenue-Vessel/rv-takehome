This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Which Milestone 1 path you chose and why
    - üíÅ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è My choice was Option B: Territory Management System
    - üí™ I feel this option was more in line with my UI intuition strengths
    - üôÖ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Data modeling and predictive analytics is not my strength, especially and given the time limit I felt:
        1. I could accomplish more if I went with Option B
        2. I could grok the requirements / needs faster



Which Milestone 2 specialization you pursued
    - No time üò≠

**AI Collaboration Report:** Specific examples of AI-generated code you improved

**Technical Decisions:** Architecture choices and trade-offs made

What you'd prioritize next with more time
    - Add map + populate with data to represent where sales reps are located
    - More granular territor locations so it's not just the general state, but more region specific
    - On the "Update selected reps" functionality feature, the Update buttonat the bottom will act wonky and jump to bottom of page if there's a high amount of reps selected so should be fixed size table
    - General UI things (font color for some parts of the UI that are too light, sizing issue with Select All in "List by territories" view)
